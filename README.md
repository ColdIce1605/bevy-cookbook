## Contribution guidelines

Contributions to improve the cookbook are always welcome.

Since this is a sort-of "best practices" guide, if you think you know of a better way to do something than what is shown in the cookbook, please propose it.

Keep everything self-contained in one document. It shall not be fragmented.

 - Large, clear headings, to visually search the document easily.
 - Focus on brevity.
 - Keep sections focused on a specific practical task, don't add unrelated things.
 - Avoid repeating information found elsewhere in the document.
 - Prefer short and clear sentences.
 - Explanations should be no more than a few sentences. Cover the most important points.
 - Point out caveats and relevant practical workarounds.
 - Keep examples minimalistic. Only show what is relevant to the task at hand. Larger examples should instead be contributed to Bevy proper.
 - Avoid long lines of code, to keep it readable on small screens.
 - Be civil. If you need a code of conduct, have a look at Bevy's.
